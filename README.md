**Computer Science Exercises in Python**

This repository showcases a range of Python programming exercises developed during Computer Science courses, starting from fundamental concepts like conditionals, loops, and working with data structures (e.g., lists and dictionaries) and advancing to object-oriented design (OOD).

The final assignment involves a simulation of the Madrid Metro system, including:
- Estimating travel times between stations.
- Accounting for line transfers.
- Real-time handling of closed stations or sections.
- Integration of structured data from external files to represent the metro network.

This project demonstrates the practical application of OOD principles and file handling in Python to solve complex, real-world problems.
